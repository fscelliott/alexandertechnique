title: "What to expect"
---

I teach out of my in-home studio in the foothills area of Albuquerque, New Mexico.
See the following logistics so you know what to expect during an Alexander Technique lesson.

#### Accessibility

There's one step up and one step down to my in-home teaching studio. Let me know if you need assistance in navigating the steps and I can help. There's a bathroom down the hall from the studio that's available for your use. The house is pet free and fragrance free. Please arrive within 5 minutes of your lesson start time. There's no waiting room, but I don't overschedule or run late on appointments.

#### Scheduling

Once you've [scheduled](/schedule) a lesson with me, we'll have a brief phone conversation to confirm the date, time, and street address. Lessons are 45 - 60 minutes. If you need to cancel, please let me know with at least 24 hours notice.

#### Attire

Please wear loose, comfortable clothing. Usually you'll want to be in bare feet or socks for your lesson. If you wear a skirt or dress, please wear shorts underneath it since you might be learning through activities such as a crawling, bending, and rolling.

#### Chair work

During a lesson, you'll learn to release unnecessary, painful, or uncomfortable contractions and tensions in your postural system. I'll put my hands on your neck, forehead, back, and other key spots where your tension habit show up, and through the feedback of my hands as you move, you'll learn to recognize and release habitual tensions. When you release, new, effective movement strategies can arise without you having to "do" anything. You simply encourage them through "nondoing" and through a thought process that is conscious, embodied, and spacial. We'll investigate through sitting down in the chair, standing up from the chair, looking up, looking down and to the sides, and other simple movement activities.

#### Massage table work

Table work is a chance for you to integrate what you've learned during movement activities while lying down. You'll lie down with your knees bent and your hands resting on your torso and sides. Gravity, coupled with my hands-on work, can encourage space and ease in your joints. Table work is also a great time for you to practice "nondoing".

#### Cost

Currently, I'm still in training to become an Alexander Technique teacher, so I'm offering a sequence of 12 lessons for free for a limited number of practice students. Your first and last lesson will be under my teacher's supervision at her Nob Hill studio, and the rest of the lessons will be at my studio.
