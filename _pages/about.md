After years of chronic pain and trying everything under the sun, the Alexander Technique was the only modality that truly catalyzed change for me. I was first introduced to the A.T. as a flute performance graduate student at music conservatory, where I was bowled over by the ways in which my tone and musicality instantly improved under the hands of my A.T. teacher. Years later, joining an AMSAT-certified teacher training course resolved my chronic hip pain post hip surgery, when dozens of other traditional and alternative modalities had failed to make a dent in my pain.

I see the A.T. as a gateway to freedom, not just in relationship to pain, but to all facets of life. The implications are deep and can take years to unfold, but the experience of a hands-on lesson is immediate, concrete, and unlike anything you've had before.
