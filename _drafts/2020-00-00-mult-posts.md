Some recent things I'm feeling grateful for in terms of my AT progress:

Dipping into old habits and recovering on my own
----

On a family vacation this summer, my two year old was feeling insecure and demanded to be held much more than usual, day after day.  In the midst of visiting family, I was too wrapped up in social stuff to think my AT thoughts much, and I started to develop knee pain from falling into my habit while holding my 27 lbs of toddler. 

When I got home, I was actually limping. I remember getting into a similar bind last summer after doing a lot of digging to repair our yard irrigation, and I wasn't able to get myself out of it until A.T. training course started up in the fall.

This time, though, I DID start to think my way out of it on my own! In the two weeks after the vacation, I thought my thoughts more and more, gradually felt less and less knee pain, and limped less and less, until my habitual asymmetrical "post hip surgery gait" was much improved. yay! 

Rocky mountain hiking
----

I went hiking recently in Rocky Mountain nation park and I did 8-mile, 5-mile, and 6-mile hikes on consecutive days! Albeit slowly, and with knee pain at the end of each hike while descending. However, the knee pain was very transitory and was gone within a couple days. I'd absolutely not have been capable of this two years ago (two years ago, I did one 8-mile hike, and then I was shot for like 2 weeks). 


Walking like a fencer
----

Last semster in the training course, I started to feel like a dancer or a fencer as I walked around my house; I felt so up, so able to pause or pivot midstride, so balanced on my feet as  I walked. If you asked me to stop midstride, the heel of my trailing leg would probably be near the ground, not pushed off it.

I lost the feeling over the summer, but only 3 weeks into this fall semester, I'm regaining it, which is so exciting for someone whose walking is so 'fraught' with injury.

Shoulders
----


I'm really starting to make progress on my shoulders! I have these odd image at the moment of the front of my shoulders going up in space as the backs of my shoulders, and elbows, go down, connected to a back-and-up from the hips and forward through the knees. I can think these thoughts without triggering shoulder/upper left rib pain at least part of the time. I'm so in love with the feeling of good use in my shoulders when my teachers gives me the experience (so emotionally freeing! such a physical relief!) and I've been so stumped about directing shoulders on my own. I've been saying for years, "I can't wait till my shoulders feel this free all the time!" Now i have a glimmer of a path toward that freedom.
