I had a private lesson with my teacher today, and had a really great moment of noticing that when I extend my left arm in front of me, I'm more likely to engage in that "spinny-twisty" habit pattern of mine (TODO: find the hanna somatics visual illustration), AND that I could notice and inhibit it happening, at least as far as my lower right back ribs area was concerned. So that was exciting! And then I was biking my small kids home from daycare (and remember, I've been struggling with left knee pain during all activities that engage my legs forEVER) and realized .... hey! I'm extending my left hand out to grasp the handlebar, coudl that be creating my twisting habit pattern and contributing to knee pain, and is it something I could inhibit? I experimented with taking that hand down to my side and looking to the right while extending it out again to the handlebar, and I *think* it might be a new pathway to tackle my habit. More experimentation needed!
