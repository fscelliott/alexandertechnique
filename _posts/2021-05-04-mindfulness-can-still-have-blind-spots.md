Fair warning, this post is a LONG one and quite personal! 


### My A.T. awareness expands unevenly

When I first started practicing the Alexander Technique, I used to imagine that my self-awareness  would expand like a lightbulb that evenly and gradually brightened in a previously dark, square, empty room.  But my experience so far is more like multiple lightbulbs in a twisty cave full of nooks and crannies; some of them brightening more quickly than others; others are still completely dark; some combine forces to dissipate shadows neither alone could have vanquished. I'm hoping for more and more of that last! 

For example, I believed that if I successfully overcame some painful habits in my right hip (on which I had surgery), then perhaps my left shoulder pain might automatically improve 'for free' even without conscious directive thought in that area. Well, yes and no...but mostly no. It was two years ago that I first changed the trajectory on my hip habit, and only now am I beginning to gain traction and clarity on that painful shoulder habit in the context of a larger pattern.

 So yes, unity of self, and *also*, parts in the context of the whole. 

### Mindfulness in AT doesn't necessarily translate to other life domains

This uneven A.T. progress recently let me admit to myself that I possibly *wasn't* aware and mindful in another important domain: my gut.  To explain, I had an attack of IBS over 10 years ago while pursuing a master's at a classic music conservatory. (I believe it was triggered by acute performance anxiety brought on by a major mismatch between my technical and aesthetic musical beliefs and those of my teacher.)  Since then I've been largely healthy (aside from avoiding onions and garlic). But after a series of stressful events starting 2019 (2 cancer diagnoses in the immediate family; gave birth to my second child; was laid off from work; started a business, covid19), I've experienced chronic, mild to moderate stomach pain -- and my previous diet modifications no longer work. 

But it just didn't make sense to me that stress or anxiety were the cause of my current pain! Here were some of the ways I convinced myself it couldn't be so:

- I wasn't experiencing anxiety or stress in the ways I'm used to identifying them (no chronically anxious thoughts I could identify. no hunched shoulders or tense back, no insomnia, etc ).
-  I tried a stress tracker that another IBS patient had developed, but the metrics (hours of rest, hours of sleep, hours spent worrying) just didn't correlate with my symptoms, since all the 'metrics' looked good for me. (enough sleep, several hours of rest a day, and not much conscious worrying)
- Not three years ago, I'd experience 6 months of extreme professional stress and was worried it would cause a flareup...but my stomach never complained!  Even during my current flareup, my rigorous GI journaling has revealed that some recent transient major stressors (such as job searching, interviewing, and negotiating an offer) *did not* worsen my symptoms; in fact, my pain was *less* than it had been at another recent time when I had fewer stressors but was eating a more "ambitious" diet (in terms of veggies).
- I've successfully used self-hypnosis to give birth twice without epidurals...but when I tried a couple weeks of gut-directed hypnotherapy apps, I didn't really feel like they worked.  I didn't identify with all the talk about calming anxiety; I wasn't *experiencing* anxiety!  Likewise I tried a week of mindful eating, but I didn't really feel it made a difference.
- I've been blessed since childhood with a pretty calm, content base state. I'm not a worrywort by nature. The only spells of anxiety I've experienced have been transient and were self-inflicted through professional ambitions; a double-edged sword, but one I continue to learn to navigate (all the more easily since I love my work).  How could stress be my root cause given my natural disposition? 


### Resistance to the mere mention of stress management

Recently I underwent a bunch of GI tests that all came back normal, and also found through extensive food journaling that I have to restrict my diet to an unhealthy extent to stay pain free (white starches, meat, dairy, and soluble fiber supplements; nary a veggie to be found). I knew something finally had to change. I sat with my spouse and talked about the next treatment options, which included functional medicine and clinically proven hypnotherapy or CBT. He started to suggest, "Maybe stress management could help..."  and I cut him off with a loud, "don't even *say* stress management!" The strength of my reaction was super interesting to me once I calmed down, and I started researching. 

I found a few resources that really changed my thinking, because they described the knee-jerk resistance to "stress management" I'd just exhibited:

- [Don't Hate Your Guts](https://donthateyourguts.com/)
- [Ep. 9 on stress of the IBS Freedom podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ibs-freedom-podcast/id1536659361)
- [Burnout](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/592377/burnout-by-emily-nagoski-phd-and-amelia-nagoski-dma/)

In addition, I also read lots of blogs by women who've recovered from IBS/SIBO/etc and are selling their healing services as dieticians and functional meds. SO many of them mentioned being super resistant to mindfulness, yoga, and psychotherapy, but that such practices became the most important things they tried.

I was reminded of Walter Carrington (an important A.T. teacher) saying something like "people are really bad at thinking [he meant a type of mindful thinking] and will do almost anything to avoid it". hah. yeah. me too, in spite of my bent for self knowledge. 

So I was willing to admit I was resistant to the idea of "stress management" or pyschological treatments for IBS, and I started to come up with a list of resistant vs. exploratory thoughts about it:


- **resistant** The main psychological treatment for IBS seems to be CBT.  What little experience i have with CTB (self-administered for anxiety around career decisions in my early 20s) gave me an aversion to it. I'm probably misinterpreting, but to me it can deny inner reality or imply that negative thoughts will hurt me and must be immediately be replaced with their positive opposites...which can feel like the opposite of compassion.  Instead I'm into mindful practices like Alexander Technique (lifetime commitment there, obviously), and believe (if not practice) some ideas around meditative/Buddhist practicies and acceptance/commitment therapy and positive neoplastic training and nonviolent communication and polyvagal theory (even if I don't think polyvagal has a solid scientific underpinning)....
  - **exploratory** The DontHateYourGut website showed me an alternative to CBT for my gut that spoke so much to my prior beliefs and experiences. Yes to somatic, relational, mindful healing! This is stuff I can dig deep into! 
- **resistant** But I've got mindfulness and somatic stuff up to my eyeballs already! I spend 6-9 hours a week actively engaged in mindfulness practices in a teacher training course for Alexander Technique. My husband and I are pretty successful mindfully parenting our 2 and 5 year old in the REI framework.  I'm have intuitive eating habits I spent four years developing in my early 20s which has given me a lasting positive relationship to eating!  I'm pretty good at feeling my feelings in a nonjudgmental, nonattachment way! You want me to do MORE?
  - **exploratory**  I remembered advanced AT practitioners' anecdotes about being very good AT teachers, but still needing meditation years later to get over negative ideas, or only discovering and releasing childhood trauma after decades of teaching. As I said earlier in this post, I'm finally willing to explore the idea that being mindful about my thoughts and emotions as related to my postural system and movement might STILL leave a blind spot about my autonomic nervous system & gut.  And yeah, I'm good at nonjudgmenetally 'feeling my feelings', but I realized that I could be doing this pretty well in some domains, BUT still *not* allowing myself to feel chronic pain/fatigue when I felt it threatened my daily ability to function; to get my professional work done; to feed my small kids dinner, etc.  OK. I can work with that. 
- **resistant:** I'm indignant. Like, I'm a highly functional, well adjusted, high achieving adult with a wonderful family, part-time work I love and meaning in life; I tick ALL THE BOXES. You're telling me I have to take on stress management as YET ANOTHER VECTOR of self-improvement and mindfulness? ARRGGH! 
  -  **exploratory**  Stress management isn't just another vector of self-improvement; it should involve fun and relational support. it should increase my ease and pleasure and safety.
- **resistant:** This sounds like a patriarchy thing! I can just picture "stress management" advice coming condescendingly from the mouth of a white older male doctor, who will subsequently dismiss me to himself as a 'nervous female'...and maybe miss some other important underlying biological cause that he would have paid attention to if I weren't a woman. At least that's the mental TV show I instantly play for myself.
  - **exploratory** I'm historically pretty darn good at advocating for myself;  I needn't fear dismissal from others. Maybe subtly, I shouldn't fear dismissing myself out of internalized sexism.
- **resistant** But I'm not obviously stressed! 
  - **exploratory** Stress comes in many forms, and the chronic stessors of my life now are sometimes vague and amorphous, compared to clear cut academic and professional situations. In fact, I'm in an incredibly demanding phase of life. It also helped when a female confidant let me in on the fact that she experienced a year of IBS in exactly my circumstances: parenting two kids under 6. Also, *hello*, every time I eat in the presence of my kids, I'm in fight or flight! (hurry up and eat before someone starts crying!)
- **resistant** But I'm coping so well with pain -- being stoic, finding joy while in pain, accepting and enduring when there's no other option.
  -  **exploratory** Actually, maybe the IBS pain has caused me stress and anxiety! And seeking to control my symptoms is in itself a fight stress response! 


So the long and short of it is, I've started a mindful journal around my gut, using ideas from psychologist Dr. Jennifer Franklin of donthateyourguts.com. I've found that when I'm strongly attracted to a philosophical or psychophysical framework, I usually need to temper my beginner's enthusiasm to actually get the most of out said framework.  Frameworks tend to have absolutist statements, but the human self is such a complex mystery that only paradoxes can accommodate absolutes. So yes, I believe in acceptance AND change; nondoing AND doing, not 'controlling' my symptoms but also reducing GI  pain in the short term where possible, etc. I also accept that usually a combination of different frameworks work best for me, and that what works in a time of crisis may not be the thing that works long term (for example, immediately after hip surgery, Feldenkrais was enormously helpful, but long term, Alexander Technique is the most fruitful path for me).

Here's to exploring!
