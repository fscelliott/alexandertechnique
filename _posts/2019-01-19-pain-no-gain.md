So I feel like last and this semester has a pattern -- I start out feeling really pumped and like I’m learning fast, then a few weeks in, I start to encounter left shoulder/neck pain and get upset about the pain, since it has a long history (basically from when I first injured my right hip almost a decade ago). 

Last Thursday I brought it up in class and we ended up talking about emotional/physical pain for quite a while. I went through two phases during these conversations. 
First, I had the following questions confusedly swirling in my head:
- If I want to work on a procedure, be it taking the back of the chair, or someone’s arm or head, but I experience pain, how do I react? Can I still learn something useful, inhibit, and direct, while experiencing the pain? It seems like sometimes yes, and sometimes no. What makes the difference?

- Is it a ‘correct’ goal to want to do an AT procedure without pain? It doesn’t seem like it in this particular circumstance, because I’m getting caught in a rollercoaster of emotions based on whether, in this particular moment, I’m doing a procedure with or without pain, and it’s exhausting.

- can I reframe the muscle pain as an opportunity to be grateful for increased awareness? I’ve come to believe that I feel increase pain, because I am MORE aware, so in that sense, I don’t get afraid anymore that the pain is a sign of wrong-doing. But, there’s a lot of emotion tied up with this particular pain pattern related to flute-playing and traumatic performance anxiety in grad-level classical conservatory. Can I sever the connection between that pain pattern and those traumatic emotions, and just experience the pain calmly?

  

After these reflections, I got stuck. I felt as if I were in a catch-22:

**If I let go of the  desire to practice AT procedures without pain, then where was my motivation to perform them at all? After all, I got into AT to resolve chronic pain!** 

THEN I had a couple big ‘ah-ha’ moments:

- This shoulder/neck pain pattern is associated with a compulsive desire to try, try, and try again. In conservatory, I was trying and trying and trying again to resolidfy what felt like a crumbling breath technique -- I was a moth to the flame, returning again and again to the practice room and only upsetting myself more and more.
     This is a similar situation! If the "taking a head" procedure causes me pain, then I keep returning to it compulsively trying to do the procedure without pain, and getting more and more agitated. THIS is what I need to inhibit -- the desire to ‘retry’ procedures that cause me pain. **I ACTUALLY NEED TO INHIBIT MY DESIRE TO TRAIN.** Seems very meta! 

My teacher showed me an alternate path out of my paralysis: 
  1. work on scaffolding procedures that eventually lead to the procedures that cause me pain

  2. start from a place that is as pain free as possible. 

  3.  Communicate my pain level on scale 0-5 in real time, and my teacher can put hands on to back me out of the pain during the procedure

So now, I conclude that I don’t necessarily have to ‘let go of the desire to do things in a pain free manner’ -- instead, I have to let go of the desire to do the *complete* procedure in spite of the pain, because that particular pain (even if not severe physically) is associated with some pretty severe emotional end-gaining. Which is to say -- sometimes I think it’s OK to experience pain and do a ‘complete’ procedure -- for example, if you can do it in a spirit of curiosity (how is this pain connecting to my habits/directions and what am I learning from it?). But it’s not OK for me right now with this particular pattern.

And the AMAZING thing is that I actually now have some tools to reduce left shoulder pain pain -- for example bending in primary in the chair and looking to the right. I didn’t have that even last semester! (And I don’t quite know what I would do if I didn’t have these tools at my disposal). 

What that means in practice:

- maybe everyone else in class does a procedure, but all I do is go into primary and look to my right. Great! That’s enough. 
- maybe I’m supposed to be observing another student's procedure, but my shoulder pain is distracting me. I give myself permission to stop paying attention to that other student, and do some self-care by going to primary, etc.
- maybe my teacher asks me to do something, and I explicitly ask for her support to inhibit my desire to do all of what she’s asking me, and only do part of it.

I feel like I can make the choice to refuse to do something if it causes me left-shoulder pain, *because* I see pathways towards eventually doing that procedure pain-free, and can *practice* them in the meantime. And that gives me a preview of what it might be like in future to find more pain-free paths. For example: my hips hurt today after working on the floor on a quilting project, but I don’t really have the skill to avoid that hip pain for the most part. But I recognize that down the road, I perhaps will make different choices when I have more tools for hip-pain avoidance.
